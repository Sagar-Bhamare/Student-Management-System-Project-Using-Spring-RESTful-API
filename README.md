# Overview
The Student Management System is a robust and feature-rich solution tailored for educational institutions seeking an efficient and organized approach to handle student-related tasks. This project employs a RESTful API architecture to facilitate seamless communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring optimal performance and scalability.

# Features
RESTful API
The core of the system is a RESTful API built using the Express.js framework, designed to adhere to REST principles. This API provides a standardized and efficient way to manage student information.

CRUD Operations
The system supports fundamental CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for student data. Administrators can easily add new students, retrieve information, update records, and delete entries as needed.

User Authentication
To enhance security, the API is equipped with user authentication mechanisms. Access to sensitive endpoints is restricted, ensuring that only authorized users can perform certain operations.

Data Validation
The backend implements robust data validation mechanisms to maintain the integrity and accuracy of the stored student information. This prevents erroneous or malicious data from compromising the system's reliability.
